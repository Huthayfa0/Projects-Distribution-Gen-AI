As deep learning focuses on building a network that resembles a human mind, sound\nrecognition is also essential. While image classification has become much advanced and widespread, audio classification is still a relatively new concept.\nThe mean idea of this project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify a given short duration sound (e.g. 10 seconds) into one of a predefined\nsound events such as music, human speech, vehicle, boom, crumpling, etc.  Audio classification can be helpful in query based multimedia retrieval, acoustic scene\nanalysis, and bio-diversity monitoring.\nFor this project, we can work on Google AudioSet, which is a vast collection of labeled audio that they collected from YouTube videos. They all are 10-seconds\nlong and are incredibly varied. We can use the audio files present in AudioSet to train and test our models. They are correctly labeled, so working with them is\nrelatively more straightforward. There are currently 632 audio event classes and more than two million sound clips present in AudioSet\n(https://research.google.com/audioset/).\n", "analysis": {"usage": {"text_units": 1, "text_characters": 1177, "features": 2}, "language": "en", "concepts": [{"text": "Acoustics", "relevance": 0.972552, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acoustics"}, {"text": "Video clip", "relevance": 0.736975, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Video_clip"}, {"text": "Google", "relevance": 0.698732, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Google"}, {"text": "Psychology", "relevance": 0.682371, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychology"}, {"text": "Thought", "relevance": 0.668795, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thought"}, {"text": "Idea", "relevance": 0.660353, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Idea"}, {"text": "YouTube", "relevance": 0.624413, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/YouTube"}, {"text": "Mind", "relevance": 0.591159, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mind"}, {"text": "Speech", "relevance": 0.550866, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Speech"}, {"text": "Viacom", "relevance": 0.540854, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viacom"}, {"text": "Sound", "relevance": 0.501008, "dbpedia_resource": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sound"}], "categories": [{"score": 0.92854, "label": "/technology and computing/hardware/computer components/sound cards"}, {"score": 0.863589, "label": "/technology and computing/mp3 and midi"}, {"score": 0.768575, "label": "/technology and computing/internet technology/web search/people search"}, {"score": 0.74159, "label": "/art and entertainment/music/music reference"}, {"score": 0.736146, "label": "/education/homework and study tips"}, {"score": 0.673909, "label": "/technology and computing/hardware/computer peripherals/computer monitors"}, {"score": 0.662078, "label": "/technology and computing/hardware/computer/portable computer"}]}, "correlations": {}}, {"id": 2, "supervisor": "Dr. Abualseoud Hanani\n", "title": "Machine learning-based system for\nevaluating short stories understanding\nfor Arabic speaking children\n", "description": "The main idea of this project is to develop a system that is able to evaluate the correctness of response of children (learners) for a given question upon a specific\ntopic automatically.

It is necessary to\naccount for quality factors when returning documents in response to a user query. Current search engines try to do that but not adequately.
